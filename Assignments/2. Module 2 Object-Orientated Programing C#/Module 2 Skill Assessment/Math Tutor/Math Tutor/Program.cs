               Purpose: Create an application that helps elementary students practice basic math problems, specifically addition and subtraction.
               The program should run in a loop, asking the user if they want to solve an addition or subtraction problem. It should then present
               the problem, allowing the student to input their answer. If the correct answer is given, it should respond with "Correct, good work!"
               If the answer is incorrect, it should respond with "Nice try, but that's incorrect." 
               (Stretch goal: Allow students to continue working on incorrect answers until they get them right). 
               The application should then prompt if they want to solve another question, starting the process over again. 
               If the students are finished, the program should thank them and exit.
            */

            // Task 1: Create a loop that continues as long as students want to see more questions
            // SubTask 1: Ask the user which problem they want to try (addition or subtraction)

            // Task 2: Create functions for addition and subtraction
            // SubTask 1: Create the problem for the user to solve (use random numbers for both sides of the equation, between 1 and 100)
            // SubTask 2: Allow the user to input the answer
            // SubTask 3: Check if the answer is correct, and if so, give the appropriate response. If incorrect, provide encouragement to try again.
            // Optional SubTask: Allow students to try to solve until the correct answer is given.
            // SubTask 4: Return to the main loop, allowing students to continue with more problems if desired.

            // Task 3: End the loop when students no longer want to continue with the quiz.
